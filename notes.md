# Calculating Macros

Order:
1. BMR
2. TDEE
3. Calorie Goal
4. Protein
5. Fat
6. Carbs

# 1. BMR Calculations
Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)

Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)

# 2. Modifiers

## TDEE 
BMR x Activity Level Multipliers = TDEE

Activity Level Multipliers:
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly Active: 1.375
- Light to Moderately Active: 1.46
- Moderately Active: 1.55
- Very Active: 1.725
- Extremely Active: 1.9

## Calorie Goal: 
TDEE * Deficit

Deficits:
- 10%
- 15% (default)
- 20% 

# 4. Protein Calculations
- How to calculate protein macros:
- **Women** = 0.6 to 1.0 g/LB in general
  - 0.8 g/LB is ideal to start
- Men = 0.8 - 1.2 g/LB in general
  - 1.0 g/LB is ideal to start


# 5. Fat Calculations
- In a Deficit: 30% of Calorie Goal
- In Maintenance: x% of Calorie Goal
- In Surplus: x% of Calorie Goal



## Personal note:
- Women: 187g protein max
  - 165g for lifestyle balance
  - Competitor, maximum 200g
- Men: unless competitor, maximum 300g
